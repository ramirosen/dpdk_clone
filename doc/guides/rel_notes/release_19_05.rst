New Features
------------

.. This section should contain new features added in this release.
   Sample format:

   * **Add a title in the past tense with a full stop.**

     Add a short 1-2 sentence description in the past tense.
     The description should be enough to allow someone scanning
     the release notes to understand the new feature.

     If the feature adds a lot of sub-features you can use a bullet list
     like this:

     * Added feature foo to do something.
     * Enhanced feature bar to do something else.

     Refer to the previous release notes for examples.

     Suggested order in release notes items:
     * Core libs (EAL, mempool, ring, mbuf, buses)
     * Device abstraction libs and PMDs
       - ethdev (lib, PMDs)
       - cryptodev (lib, PMDs)
       - eventdev (lib, PMDs)
       - etc
     * Other libs

     =========================================================

* **Added Stack API.**

  Added a new stack API for configuration and use of a bounded stack of
  pointers. The API provides MT-safe push and pop operations that can operate
  on one or more pointers per operation.

  The library supports two stack implementations: standard (lock-based) and lock-free.
  The lock-free implementation is currently limited to x86-64 platforms.

* **Added Lock-Free Stack Mempool Handler.**

  Added a new lock-free stack handler, which uses the newly added stack
  library.

* **Updated KNI module and PMD.**

  Updated the KNI kernel module to set the max_mtu according to the given
  initial MTU size. Without it, the maximum MTU was 1500.

  Updated the KNI PMD driver to set the mbuf_size and MTU based on
  the given mb-pool. This provide the ability to pass jumbo frames
  if the mb-pool contains suitable buffers' size.

* **Added the AF_XDP PMD.**

  Added a Linux-specific PMD driver for AF_XDP, it can create the AF_XDP socket
  and bind it to a specific netdev queue, it allows a DPDK application to send
  and receive raw packets through the socket which would bypass the kernel
  network stack to achieve high performance packet processing.

* **Updated Solarflare network PMD.**

  Updated the sfc_efx driver including the following changes:

  * Added support for Rx descriptor status and related API in a secondary
    process.
  * Added support for Tx descriptor status API in a secondary process.
  * Added support for RSS RETA and hash configuration get API in a secondary
    process.
  * Added support for Rx packet types list in a secondary process.
  * Added Tx prepare to do Tx offloads checks.
  * Added support for VXLAN and GENEVE encapsulated TSO.

* **Updated Mellanox drivers.**

   New features and improvements were done in mlx4 and mlx5 PMDs:

   * Added firmware version reading.

* **Renamed avf to iavf.**

  Renamed Intel Ethernet Adaptive Virtual Function driver ``avf`` to ``iavf``,
  which includes the directory name, lib name, filenames, makefile, docs,
  macros, functions, structs and any other strings in the code.

* **Updated the enic driver.**

  * Fixed several flow (director) bugs related to MARK, SCTP, VLAN, VXLAN, and
    inner packet matching.
  * Added limited support for RAW.
  * Added limited support for RSS.
  * Added limited support for PASSTHRU.

* **Updated the ixgbe driver.**

  New features for VF:

  * Added promiscuous mode support.

* **Updated the ice driver.**

  * Added support of SSE and AVX2 instructions in Rx and Tx paths.
  * Added package download support.
  * Added Safe Mode support.
  * Supported RSS for UPD/TCP/SCTP+IPV4/IPV6 packets.

* **Updated the i40e driver.**

  New features for PF:

  * Added support for VXLAN-GPE packet.
  * Added support for VXLAN-GPE classification.

* **Updated the QuickAssist Technology PMD.**

  Added support for AES-XTS with 128 and 256 bit AES keys.

* **Updated AESNI-MB PMD.**

  Added support for out-of-place operations.

* **Updated the IPsec library.**

  The IPsec library has been updated with AES-CTR and 3DES-CBC cipher algorithms
  support. The related ipsec-secgw test scripts have been added.

* **Updated the testpmd application.**

  Improved testpmd application performance on ARM platform. For ``macswap``
  forwarding mode, NEON intrinsics were used to do swap to save CPU cycles.


Removed Items
-------------

.. This section should contain removed items in this release. Sample format:

   * Add a short 1-2 sentence description of the removed item
     in the past tense.

   This section is a comment. Do not overwrite or remove it.
   Also, make sure to start the actual text at the margin.
   =========================================================


API Changes
-----------

.. This section should contain API changes. Sample format:

   * sample: Add a short 1-2 sentence description of the API change
     which was announced in the previous releases and made in this release.
     Start with a scope label like "ethdev:".
     Use fixed width quotes for ``function_names`` or ``struct_names``.
     Use the past tense.

   This section is a comment. Do not overwrite or remove it.
   Also, make sure to start the actual text at the margin.
   =========================================================

* eal: the type of the ``attr_value`` parameter of the function
  ``rte_service_attr_get()`` has been changed
  from ``uint32_t *`` to ``uint64_t *``.

* vfio: Functions ``rte_vfio_container_dma_map`` and
  ``rte_vfio_container_dma_unmap`` have been extended with an option to
  request mapping or un-mapping to the default vfio container fd.


ABI Changes
-----------

.. This section should contain ABI changes. Sample format:

   * sample: Add a short 1-2 sentence description of the ABI change
     which was announced in the previous releases and made in this release.
     Start with a scope label like "ethdev:".
     Use fixed width quotes for ``function_names`` or ``struct_names``.
     Use the past tense.

   This section is a comment. Do not overwrite or remove it.
   Also, make sure to start the actual text at the margin.
   =========================================================

* ethdev: Additional fields in rte_eth_dev_info.

  The ``rte_eth_dev_info`` structure has had two extra fields
  added: ``min_mtu`` and ``max_mtu``. Each of these are of type ``uint16_t``.
  The values of these fields can be set specifically by the PMD drivers as
  supported values can vary from device to device.

* cryptodev: in 18.08 new structure ``rte_crypto_asym_op`` was introduced and
  included into ``rte_crypto_op``. As ``rte_crypto_asym_op`` structure was
  defined as cache-line aligned that caused unintended changes in
  ``rte_crypto_op`` structure layout and alignment. Remove cache-line
  alignment for ``rte_crypto_asym_op`` to restore expected ``rte_crypto_op``
  layout and alignment.
